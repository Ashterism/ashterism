<p>ADD PCITURE OF DESERT - and add both to a container</p>

<p>I was a pretty clear evening, with little wind to pick up dust, and little light from the moon.  I’d done a quick test in Abu Dhabi to make sure the tracker was basically working, but the light pollution makes it hard to check the tracking or GoTo functionality, so the first 20 mins was just playing with functionalities and taking some shots to check it was working as expected.  All seemed well.</p>

<p>Although I didn’t make much of a plan beforehand (lesson learnt!) I took a series of sets of shots of Orion to see what was possible:</p>

<p>Astrophotography Sessions Recap:
01: Setting up and trying a few settings
02: 0.6 sec, 400mm, f/8, 79 shots, ISO 3200
03: 8 sec, 400mm, f/8, 81 shots, ISO 3200
04: 25 sec, 400mm, f/8, 58 shots, ISO 3200
05: 25 sec, 335mm, f/8, 80 shots, ISO 3200
06: 25 sec, 335mm, f/8, 80 shots, ISO 3200 (noticeably dustier as the session progressed)</p>

<p>It was interesting to see how the images differed - and in the last set, how much the time (and I think dust in the air) impacted the image quality, despite having the same settings:</p>
