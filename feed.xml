I found that I should apply the ‘“500 rule”’ (which meant use 0.3sec exposure time), take a hundred or so images, and then stack them in astrophotography software.  Lastly I would need to do some basic processing to the images to “adjust the curves” and bring out the colours more and reduce the noise. Lots to learn then!</p>

<p>The 500 rule is: max shutter speed = effective focal length / 500.</p>

<p>I have a Canon R7 with a 1.6x crop factor, so my effective focal length (using a Skywatcher 200P/1000) is 1.6*1000 = 1600.</p>

<p>500 / 1600 = 0.3125 seconds.</p>

<p>Equipped with this knowledge, I lined up the scope on the nebula, and swapped in the camera.  It was a little misty, so the stars were not quite as clear as last week, especially through the optics, but I was able to focus using a high exposure and ISO setting.  I then reduced the settings back down to 0.3 and ISO 6400 and took 160+ shots.  I did this using HDR+ mode (for faster shooting) and holding down the shoot button on the Canon Connect app so I could avoid touching the camera and introducing wobble.</p>

<p>Tip if using Canon Connect - before going out, increase the delay on your phones lock screen to 3 or 5 mins (or turn it off) as otherwise you have to reconnect each time the screen locks, which means realigning the scope again once it’s reconnected.</p>

<p>The single images at ⅓ sec exposure were underwhelming, but with some basic processing came out looking pretty great (for a beginner!). When I was first out, I also took another batch of 150+ shots using ¼ sec exposures incase there was wobble in the first set, but didn’t end up processing them.</p>

<p>There are a lot of YouTube videos on how to stack and/or process your images, and I found most to either skip some steps or simply not work for me.  My goal was to figure out how to “simply” stack the images into one, and then how to balance the contrast/ brightness / colours to bring out the nebula.</p>

<p>I initially used Siril to do the stacking, and then tried processing the stacked image separately in Siril and Photoshop.  I got more depth of colour in Photoshop, but I personally preferred the cleaner, more ethereal feel of the Siril edit.  I definitely have a huge way to go,  I feel I’m starting to understand the process now, and it’s really encouraging to have achieved these pictures, especially without use of a tracker.</p>

<p>I’ll put the steps I followed to stack and process my images into a separate post for reference.</p>

Decided to focus on this nebula for a while and try and use it to learn how to shoot nebulas and understand the processes involved before getting distracted by the idea of upgrading kit etc, so took some initial shoots to learn from.</p>

<p>Exposure time vs trailing going to be an issue.  Tried 3.2sec, 2.5secs, and 1 sec, and various ISOs.  Even 1 sec showed trailing, which isn’t ideal!  Even with trailing though, the images are awe-inspiring - you can actually see the clouds.</p>

<p>On a 2 sec exposure, iso25600 had the best detail, though iso12800 was still good:</p>

<p>Getting the focus right was also key (see below), but made difficult by even a tiny turn of the focus dials introducing a lot of shake, and then having to track the telescope back to centre once its stopped moving.  Helps me understand why people recommend upgrading the focus mechanism or investing in an autofocus (one day!).</p>

It seemed better, but I eventually realised it was still causing wobble so ended up moving the telescope onto the grass.  More successfully, I added a shortcut to my iphone to toggle on/off a red colour filter and turn white point off (make it less bright and red) - just in case I need to look anything up without impacting my night vision too much.</p>

<p>I took some better images of Venus, this time at 1/4000, 1/2000, 1/1000 at iso100.  I think best balance of clarity/brightness at 1/2000 I think, but will have to retry on solid ground.</p>

<p>Although I was out for sunset, Mercury and Saturn were just too low in the west for me to be able to see due to some trees in that direction.  Keen to look at Saturn when it’s higher in April though.  I tried to find Uranus, but without success.  I did some across the Pleiades though, which caught my attention for much of the evening.</p>

<p>I’m finding myself happily looking through the scope or just my binos more and more, with photography taking a bit of a back seat.  I can definitely see myself doing more of both - certainly in the warmer months when I’ve worked out how to sit and observe rather than stand (or contort myself around) the scope for long periods in the cold.</p>

<p>Pleiades shots weren’t great, and didn’t match up to what I could see in the scope.  I will try this again with the telescope on firmer ground though. I did particularly like this string of stars you can see in the image below, nestled into the Pleiades cluster</p>

  <figcaption>0.5 sec at iso6400 (any slower exposure had trails due to wobble)</figcaption>

<p>It was Jupiter that made me realise I had a serious wobble issue when I couldn’t get a clearer image than below left.  After moving the telescope onto the grass I got a better image, with the bands just starting to be visible.  This isn’t far off what I could see in the scope, though I suspect I can capture a lot better detail I learn and practice more.</p>

<p>Otherwise, I took some shots of Ursa Major and Minor together, then mostly played around with some light painting ideas - though one for another time.</p>

I got out a few times this week to familiarise myself with the stars and the telescope.  I’ve started reading “Nightwatch”, which is excellently written for the newbie, and really feeding my sense of awe and wonder at the universe - and giving some helpful pointers to actually get started.</p>

<p>Key amongst these, is that you can start to learn to navigate the stars by just learning the Big Dipper and Orion - as these point to various other stars and constellations.</p>

<p>My mind is a bit blown by Orion nebula.  Just sat there in the middle of Orion literally generating stars…</p>

<p>Anyway, I took a few photos of Venus - with my Camera (Canon R7 with 100-400mm) and also through the Skywatcher 200p.  On review, I needed a much shorter shutter speed - I used 1/30th and above, but will try 1/250 and 1/1000 next time, sticking with a low iso.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/25_03/25_02_27_01.png" alt="Very over exposured image of Venus" />
  <figcaption>0.5 sec - way too over exposed.</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/25_03/25_02_27_02.png" alt="Over exposured image of Venus" />
  <figcaption>1/30th - still over exposed.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Also took some pictures of Mars, Orion, and the Big Dipper / Ursa Major with the R7/ 16mm.  They came out better, but still some blurring as using longer exposures (15-30 secs).  Without a tracker you get the trails, so I will try 5,10,15 secs and some higher ISOs next time.</p>

  <img src="/assets/images/25_03/25_02_27_3.png" alt="Picture of Orion constellation in night sky" />

  <figcaption>Big Dipper - 1*30sec  - not as bad, but still gives an “out of focus” appearance.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>However, getting better at actually getting the focus right (just back from actual infinite it seems), and did get a nice (slightly tweaked in lightroom) pic of the Big Dipper with trees in the foreground (perhaps more by accident than design!).  I think I need to worry less about the pictures looking too dark ‘in the field’ and lean into post-processing to balance lighting etc.  Even when images look great on my high-res laptop screen, they need brightening for posting online or sharing with friends etc anyway.</p>

<p>Next time I’m out going to try some of the planets again, and also the same Orion/Big Dipper asterims to try and lock in the settings, and help me with remembering their utility as signposts.</p>]]></content><author><name>Musings by Ash</name></author><category term="astro" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[In anticipation of the much talked about planetary alignment on the 28th (tonight!)
