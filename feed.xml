<p><em>10th May 2025 - 11th May 2025</em></p>

<p>üåî Moon: Waxing Gibbous 96% illumination</p>

<p>Although easily one of most prepared for sessions to date, the astrophotography did not go to plan!  But that‚Äôs okay - I was blown away by seeing the Hercules cluster for the first time - and whilst the nearly full moon hid the milky-way and weakened the DSOs, it was amazing to see through a 400mm lens.</p>

<p>When we arrived, it was a little windier than usual, so I set up in a small basin between a few dunes to reduce the potential wind wobble.  I had some issues with the tracker at first, but now I have the iOptron Commander Lite app was quickly able to deduce it was because the date had reset to the unix epoch(Jan, 1970).  Once corrected it was working well, though I definitely didn‚Äôt have the alignment quite right.</p>

<p>Alignment in sand is proving a bit tricky tbh, I probably need to push the tripod in deeper than I‚Äôve been doing. In theory if I get it perfectly balanced and broadly aligned before the stars come up, I can just make micro-tweaks once I can do proper polar alignment.</p>

<p>As it was due to set earlier, I started with the Beehive cluster (M44).  Unfortunately, between the GoTo being a bit off due to my patchy alignment, a relatively high zoom, and not really being sure what I was looking for, the Beehive Cluster was mostly out of frame.  The last few shots started to capture it in the top (right) of the frame - but all in all not a great success.  That said, now I‚Äôve had a chance to read up a bit on the Beehive cluster, really keen to photo and learn more about clusters.  There are thousands of stars in the cluster, which is incredible; imagine what the night skies must look like standing on a planet in the cluster!</p>

  </figure>

<p>Next up, I turned my attention to the moon.  I was almost full, and one of the things that I was super keen to try the first time I was out in the desert with my camera, was to turn my 400mm lens onto it (I only had the kit lens with me on that trip).  I took quite a few pics of the moon that I was happy with - the issue really is how do you decide which is best / which to process?  Unlike with DSO, it felt like you could take one good shot, and you‚Äôre done.  I‚Äôm sure there is a whole world of detail to how get the perfect shot though, so something else to look into!</p>

<p>Moving on from the moon, I tracked around to the Hercules cluster.  This is apparently visible to the naked eye, though I suspect only if you have perfect vision and are in a dark-sky site‚Ä¶</p>

<p>There is no way to describe the Hercules cluster short of amazing.  At first it looks like a blurry patch on the camera, like you‚Äôve had too much wobble on a distant star.  But as you zoom in and get in focus, the individual stars around the edge start to stand out and you realise you‚Äôre looking at a huge cluster of over 100,000 stars.</p>

<p>Hercules is 25,000 light years away from Earth, and said to be one of the oldest objects in the Milky way at some 11 billion years old.  It‚Äôs also one of the brightest clusters, and quite popular with astronomers and astrophotographers, no doubt because of it‚Äôs awe inspiring nature!.</p>

<p>Lastly, as there was a full moon, I tried setting up a timelapse with the skyhunter, so it would track the earth moving whilst the moon stayed still (relative to the earth).  Unfortunately, using the 16mm lens this did not come out at all well.  All the frames were way too dark, and the moon a pixelated light in the centre.  At some point the tracker battery died, and the moon dropped out of the centre, and then as the day started to break the images showed the lens covered in dew‚Ä¶ So all in all, much to learn there!</p>

<p>Looking back at it‚Ä¶ a mixed bag of shots, but some great experiences.  Also keen to get hold of my binoculars again - and get a raspberry pi timelapse camera set up so I can try more time lapses of the stars, sunrise, and the camp generally‚Ä¶  And now with the stack of out of frame beehive cluster shots and useless timelapse shots, I finally feel comfortable breaking my duck and getting rid of some photos!</p>]]></content><author><name>Musings by Ash</name></author><category term="Astro" /><category term="astro" /><category term="astrophotography" /><category term="messier-13" /><category term="hercules-cluster" /><category term="hercules" /><category term="messier-44" /><category term="beehive-cluster" /><category term="lunarphotography" /><category term="full-moon" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Also see: Planning ahead Desert camping 10/05/25]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Desert trip 10/05</title><link href="https://ashterism.com/travels/2025/05/10/desertCamping.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Desert trip 10/05" /><published>2025-05-10T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-05-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://ashterism.com/travels/2025/05/10/desertCamping</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ashterism.com/travels/2025/05/10/desertCamping.html"><![CDATA[<p>Desert camping trip</p>

<p>10th May 2025</p>

<p>Driving the 90 odd minutes out to the milkyway spot there is always a moment when it‚Äôs suddenyl just desert for hundreds of miles, with the sun blazing down on one side, and dunes and the road extending out for miles ahead - and it‚Äôs a great feeling.</p>

<p>Headed to what we now consider to be ‚Äúour spot‚Äù a kilometer or two into the desert from the track road.  Over the last month or maybe a bit longer since we were last there, the dunes have shifted considerably, and so we had to carefully path a new route out.  Strange to not have any tyre tracks to follow to know which were the safe routes over/ through the dunes, but fun to figure it out!</p>

<p>It must have rained fairly recently, not just because of the explosion of greenery (for the desert), but the crisp feel to the tops of ridges on the sand.  We managed to find what we thought was our last spot - dunes have shifted, but the tallest dune (‚Äòsundowners dune‚Äô) was still recognisable.</p>

<p>We were carrying on the campfire veggie kebab concept, still good - some advancements on how to balance them (using a small wire grill plate leaned into the centre of the fire). Also used up the last two timtams with marshmallows.  Still the king of smores, but unfortunately hard to get hold of out here‚Ä¶</p>

<p>We were lucky with the weather - despite the encroaching summer it was cooler than the last time we were out - but we still turned our attention to how to extend the camping season a little longer.  Some shade would be helpful - both for the afternoons when you arrive, and also for the mornings - partially to keep the car (or a tent) cooler, and darker‚Ä¶ and for having breakfast under.  We‚Äôve been giving some thought to how to rig up a tarp, so hopefully get to try that out next time.</p>

<p>Whilst reinflating it occurred to us that we could just time the first tyre and then start the next one off and sit in the nice air conditioned car for a set amount of time before we needed to get out and stop it.  Obvious when you say it, but taken us quite a lot of trips to realise it!</p>]]></content><author><name>Musings by Ash</name></author><category term="Travels" /><category term="desert" /><category term="uae" /><category term="camping" /><category term="kebabs" /><category term="sunset" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Desert camping trip]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Planning ahead‚Ä¶</title><link href="https://ashterism.com/astro/2025/05/09/planning-ahead.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Planning ahead‚Ä¶" /><published>2025-05-09T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-05-09T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://ashterism.com/astro/2025/05/09/planning-ahead</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ashterism.com/astro/2025/05/09/planning-ahead.html"><![CDATA[<p>Heading to the desert this weekend, and not sure what would be the best target.

<p>‚Ä¶for future reference‚Ä¶ <br />
üåï 12th May - Full moon <br />
üåó 20th May - Last quarter <br />
üåë 27 May - New Moon <br /></p>

<p>Other options are some moon photography, and/or targeting some brighter DSOs.  It‚Äôs all good practice, and ultimately the journey is as important as the destination!  I did look at getting a narrowband filter, but not cheap so something else for the one-day kit list.  Some DSOs which are apparently bright enough to still be good targets with a bright moon are below with some notes:</p>

<p>May 9th: Sunset: 6:55pm, Astronomical Twilight ends: 8:18pm</p>

<p><strong>General notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Tracking alignment going to be really important.  Maybe brush up on that.</li>
  <li>Over 1600 ISO likely to be too noisy.</li>
  <li>Lower objects will have more atmospheric disturbance (wobble)</li>
  <li>Bahtinov would be really handy (still dont have one)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Possible sequence:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>M13 (Hercules Cluster) - Early, while it‚Äôs high and bright.</li>
  <li>M44 (Beehive Cluster) - Before it sets around midnight.</li>
  <li>M5 (Serpens Cluster) - High all night, so good for a longer session.</li>
  <li>Omega Centauri &amp; M8 - maybe skip as low?</li>
</ol>

<p>Could also be an opportunity to find some constellations.  It‚Äôs something I really wanted to learn back at the beginning, but with moving somewhere that requires travelling for a good night sky, it‚Äôs taken a bit of a back</p>

<p>Then also the Moon and Jupiter.  Mars up too but bit small maybe?  Jupiter setting quite early might mean I could get it with desert in the foreground?  Get in some jupiter practice before the next opposition in January.</p>

<p>Also - another thought was doing an Earth rotation timelapse.  Requires perfect alignment so maybe not idea - but one I could do in an area with more light pollution in future maybe?</p>

<p>Lastly, and for some reason often forgotten though one of the things I love doing - astro landscapes!</p>

It was my birthday weekend, and my partner Lauren had given me a cryptic crossword clue to solve in order to work out where we were headed.</p>

    <figcaption>A fun clue that shows playing minute cryptic is paying off!</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

<p>The answer to this is <span class="spoiler-sparkle" data-reveal="Dhow boat">spoilers!</span>   Musandam, a part of Oman separated from the rest of Oman by the emirate of Fujairah (and a little of Sharjah too) is famous (here at least) for it‚Äôs Dhow boat trips around the beautifully intricate mountains of it‚Äôs coastline.  That said, RAK and Fujairah both have some favoured spots for us, so not an easy one to guess!</p>

  </figure>
</div>

<p>The border crossings between Oman and the UAE are famously hard to predict, but our journey across was smooth and the border staff all friendly and not overly interested in making us unpack - which was appreciated as we had a car load of gear as we were also planning to camp in the mountains on the second night.  As it stands (stood), <a href="https://www.customs.gov.om/en/traveller-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the rules allow</a> (non-muslim) tourists to bring in 2ltr of wine and 48 beers, but are still tight on cameras and drones, though I suspect a standard DSLR without a massive telescopic lens would be fine.</p>

<p>After a short trip through the twisty roads along the coast, we made it to Kasab and got aboard the Dhow.</p>

<p>Setting off around 4pm, almost immediately we saw the humpback dolphins Musandam is known for.  They come right up to the boat and play in the wake as it enables them to swim faster than normal.</p>

<p>After pootling through the khors (water inlets between the mountains) for a few hours, we dropped anchor and the boat crew served a light dinner.  We settled in with some tunes and a few beers to enjoy the stunning views in the (relatively) cool air.  We were treated to an incredible sunset and probably took far too many photos of it!</p>

<p>Before long, we were greeted by the stars up above the boat.  This was our cue to jump in the water and play with the incredible bioluminescent phytoplankton, and floating about drinking in the stars.  There is something truly special about looking at the stars lying in the sea - and it definitely made me want to improve my constellation knowledge.</p>

<p>The plankton can only be described as magical.  Whenever you move they light up, like something out of the first Avatar movie, and creating a pulse of water with your hand emits a light trail forwards like you‚Äôre Harry Potter‚Ä¶. Sadly we didn‚Äôt have a waterproof camera with us and attempts to get photos from the boat didn‚Äôt work, so we‚Äôll just have to go back üôÇ
<br /><br />
The evening passed too quickly and before long we were settling down to sleep on the deck of the boat. We were provided blankets but it was warm enough not to need them, and the lack of waves and complete quiet made it fairly easy to fall off to sleep.</p>

<p>The next day after breakfast we had a little snorkel, initially around the boat in the clouds of fish that were attracted by the boat host throwing bits of bread in the water, and then close to the shore.  There was tonnes to see, including parrotfish, butterfly fish, and trigger fish, as well as what I think were jawfish in a symbiotic relationship with shrimp, making a shared burrow.<br />
<br />
We whiled away the day looking at scenery, taking photos, snorkelling, playing backgammon and cards and chatting, whilst the boat moved around the khor and occasionally dropped anchor.  The snorkelling was always great, and we spotted what, after a lot of debate we finally agreed was a green (not hawksbill) turtle.  Cue a commitment to improve knowledge (and identification) of arabian gulf marine life.  A perfect day really.</p>

<p>Once we were back on land, we headed to the large supermarket in Khasab to get some provisions for camping.  They didn‚Äôt have our usual option of veggie burgers/sausages so we bought some skewers, paneer and halloumi, for what has turned out to be a great camping option of camp-fire cooked veggie kebabs.<br />
<br />
From there headed up the mountain looking for a spot with a view to camp.  Fortunately ‚Äòwild camping‚Äô as we‚Äôd call it in the UK is allowed in most of Musandam, so it was just a case of finding a place to pitchup. We followed an incredibly smooth road out of Khasab towards the mountains, which soon gave way to being built, and after maybe thirty minutes the temporary aggregate road developed into a very steep winding mountain road - 4WD advised.</p>

<p>Another 20-30 minutes later and we reached a Wadi where we‚Äôd initially thought we‚Äôd be able to camp, but it was immediately apparent it was inhabited, with homes dotted around the edges and the green land in the middle fenced for animals.  At this point we decided to consult the map properly and then push on to the next (and final) potential location, failing which we‚Äôd just about have time to get most the way back down before the light fell.
<br /><br />
Fortunately there was an incredible spot at the top with an amazing view down the valley, just before the final peak, where the ‚Äòtop secret‚Äô military base sat looming above (the one you‚Äôre not supposed to go anywhere near and is probably the reason advanced camera equipment &amp; drones aren‚Äôt permitted at the border‚Ä¶). Any concerns about proximity to it were allayed by it being pretty small (far away) from us, and the evidence of numerous fires and previous camps around where we were. <br />
<br />
At one point a utility truck came over, but they were just checking we were alright.  This is one of the really nice elements of being in more rural / remote parts of this part of the world -  the experiences of strangers looking out for you or offering you food, dates, water etc; an enduring thread of the Bedouin culture of hospitality and looking out for one another.</p>

<p>The sun soon fell, and evening turned to night as we experimented with how best to balance and cook our kebabs - investigating the possibilities having small rocks and stones (not to be found in the desert) provided. Chatter and a few toasts to the final evening of a fun trip later, we dowsed the fire and headed to bed.</p>

<p>The trip back down the mountain was fairly uneventful, save stopping to take photos of the view and free-roaming donkeys, and then it as plain sailing back to a relatively quick border crossing and then the long drive home.  All in all, a wonderful trip.</p>

I had a few goes trying slightly different approaches, which I‚Äôll outline below.  I used ‚Äústandard settings‚Äù for things like registering, though realising now I come to writing it up, I don‚Äôt have these written down anywhere.  I‚Äôve recently had a go at editing some old photos where I‚Äôve had to play with some of the settings I rarely change so it‚Äôs a good time to document.</p>

<p>ADD ‚ÄúSTANDARD‚Äù settings</p>

<p><strong>For my first pass (set 05):</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Stacked in siril</li>
  <li>No editing in siril</li>
  <li>Exported as Tif</li>
  <li>Tweaked curves / auto coloured / added a saturated layer</li>

<p>Finally getting round to putting this up on the blog, realising it would be helpful to have recorded if I made these changes using the Camera Raw filter, with adjustment layers, or just directly etc.  Be good to record more detail with that.  I do like this image though, despite the green tinge.  It‚Äôs got a sharpness and a nice clarity to Iona Orionis (Naif Al Saif) - the double star, and brightest star in the sword (to the left of the main nebula in the centre).  Interestingly in the Orion constellation, this is towards the bottom (near the knees), so rotating it 90degrees anti-clockwise would be how we typically think of the orion orientation.  The two stars at the bottom (on the left) aren‚Äôt Saiph and Rigel though, but Ori D and U respectively.</p>

<p><strong>For the second pass (set 05)</strong> <br />
The next day I had another go at editing the .psd for the above,  I added a colour level adjustment layer and tweaked the green channel level, but couldn‚Äôt reduce the green tinge without removing significant amounts of detail.</p>

<p>So, I went back to Siril and used the ‚ÄúRemove green noise‚Äù function, but that just looked red‚Ä¶ so I undid that and instead used the ‚ÄúColour calibration &gt; Photometric colour calibration‚Äù tool and plate matched to M42 to balance out colours.</p>

<p>Then did some googling‚Ä¶ got StarNet2++ working (<a href="https://www.cloudynights.com/topic/881125-help-mac-m1-with-siril-how-to-add-starnet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">‚Äúwith thanks to this article on Cloudynights‚Äù</a>) and split out the nebula from the stars, then applied ‚ÄúRemove green noise‚Äù (small change but bit better).</p>

<p>Exported as 16bit tif (as 32 bit file sizes are huge and 16bit apparently the sweet spot for size/detail).</p>

<p><u>Starless:</u></p>

<p>Mixed feelings on this image.  There is more detail visible in the areas overexposed in the first pass, but overall it feels a bit over processed and smoothed out.  That said, Iota Orionis is quite sharp - so the splitting out of layers maybe helped preserved the stars, but I lost the sharpness in the way I edited the nebula?  Might be worth another try at some point, Orion is below the horizon now till winter so plenty of time to practice!</p>

<p><strong>For the third pass I used set 04</strong>
Processing takes quite a bit of time, so this set was done on the 13th April.</p>

<p>Initially created in Siril and then without editing, exported (building on learning above) as a 16bit tif.  Played around in Photoshop but wasn‚Äôt looking great, so went back to the stacked file in Siril.</p>

I was a pretty clear evening, with little wind to pick up dust, and little light from the moon.  I‚Äôd done a quick test in Abu Dhabi to make sure the tracker was basically working, but the light pollution makes it hard to check the tracking or GoTo functionality, so the first 20 mins was just playing with functionalities and taking some shots to check it was working as expected.  All seemed well.</p>

<p>Although I didn‚Äôt make much of a plan beforehand (lesson learnt!) I took a series of sets of shots of Orion to see what was possible:</p>

<p>It was interesting to see how the images differed - and in the last set, how much the time (and I think dust in the air) impacted the image quality, despite having the same settings:</p>

Obviously quite a lot to do to process all these now, though will probably pick the best one or two batches and work on those.  Looks like maybe 04 but will depend on how many good / bad frames in the batch.  Going to be a few months where it‚Äôs too hot to get out to the desert, so good to have plenty of photos to practice processing on!</p>

<p>First off, top tip!  Order a vixen-style dovetail plate if you don‚Äôt already have one.  This is a little bar that you attach your DSLR to that then slots onto the head of the tracker.  It‚Äôs like the one you get on a camera tripod but bigger.  It‚Äôs not included and you can‚Äôt attach a camera without one.  Fortunately I was able to use a similar bar from the telescope to rig something up the first night, or it would have been disappointing not to be able to use it at all!.  The first dovetail plate I ordered was too small as it didn‚Äôt easily allow for the LCD panel to open past the tightening bolts on the tracker - so I ordered a longer (20cm+) one which has worked better.</p>

<p>Putting the tracker together was fairly straightforward, and it can be controlled using the iOptron Commander app on a windows computer, or the Sky Safari Plus app (iOS/Android).  I couldn‚Äôt find the iOptron Commander app on the App store, so I contacted iOptron support and downloaded Sky Safari instead.  I latter learnt iOptron support are really friendly, and that the Commander app won‚Äôt be available for a while due to the developers needing to reregister with the app store or suchlike, so hopefully it‚Äôll be back soon.</p>

<p>There was a bit of a steep learning curve to using a tracker, though it was really helpful as it made me realise I‚Äôd been skipping some steps with the telescope too‚Ä¶ The key steps seem to be aligning the telescope to polaris, and then giving it some reference points so it can ‚Äúlock in‚Äù exactly where it is and slew properly.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Prepare the tracker and camera (whilst there is still light)<br />
 a. Set the tripod up and use a compass to ensure RA axis pointing north<br />
 b. Adjust level to be flat (adjust leg lengths)<br />
 c. Set up the camera on the tripod<br />
 d. Make sure camera parallel to the RA axis (pointing ‚Äústraight‚Äù)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Physically align the tracker to Polaris<br />
 a. Once dark, line up Polaris through the hole in the RA axis knob<br />
 b. Double check everything is still level</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Set Zero Position<br />
 a. Once all aligned, turn the tracker off, then turn it back off (this ‚Äúzeros‚Äù it)<br />
 b. Alternatively you can use the iOptron Commander app to set ‚Äúzero position‚Äù</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Align to visible stars (for GoTo accuracy ‚Äì not essential for just tracking)<br />
 a. Manually slew to a bright star (like Capella)<br />
 b. Select that star in the app (i.e., Sky Safari) and tap on ‚Äúalign‚Äù<br />
 c. Manually slew to another star<br />
 d. Select that star in the app and tap on ‚Äúalign‚Äù</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Unfortunately it took me quite a while to figure out how to get the telescope working correctly, and it was initially going to the opposite of where i was telling it to go using the GoTo, i.e. if it needed to track up and left to go from where it was to where i wanted it, it would instead go down and right.  After reading the manual and checking all the settings, reading all the forums etc, I contacted the seller and iOptron for help.  In the meantime I also borrowed a Windows PC (I use Mac) and used it to download and install the latest firmware.  This seemed to fix the problem, but the next day I was emigrating - so not had a chance to properly test it again.</p>

<p><strong>Settings to use to add the iOptron SkyHunter to Sky Safari:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>iOptron CEM-120</li>
  <li>Equatorial  GOTO (German)</li>
  <li>Connect via WiFi</li>
  <li>IP address - 10.10.100.254</li>
  <li>port number - 8899</li>

This (inevitably?) led to me ordering a star tracker which is due any day now, so I thought it would be a good opportunity to try a timelapse with last nights clear sky as it‚Äôs something I‚Äôd love to do with a clear milyway sky one night.</p>

<p>The setting was my Dad‚Äôs house in France, which, although only one room deep, looks like a classic French chateaux complete with the amazing roof line they have - so I thought a great foreground item.  I definitely have a lot to learn but it was an interesting process and I‚Äôm keen to try again soon now I‚Äôve read up on how to do it better.</p>

<p>Yesterday evening, I set the camera up on a tripod looking up at the sky over the house.  I put it in Av mode, with an interval timer set for 45secs.  Around 45 mins before sunset I set it going and checked back in on it periodically.  I noticed at twilight that the stars were visible to the eye, but not appearing in the photos, so I switched it to manual and adjusted the ISO and SS manually so the stars were appearing in the shots.</p>

<p>When I checked back in an hour later (around half nine), the shots were again underexposed so you couldn‚Äôt see the stars.  I adjusted the settings again to make the stars visible and left it to it again.  The camera carried on snapping away until around 4:30 when the battery died.</p>

<p>I retrieved the camera and looked at the images in the morning - and then went down a rabbit hole of videos on how to actually make a timelapse on my laptop - and videos about how to get the perfect outcomes from ‚ÄúHoly Grail‚Äù timelapses.  This is the name for timelapses which transition day-to-night I‚Äôve learnt.</p>

<div class="markdown-alert markdown-alert-note"><p class="markdown-alert-title"><svg class="octicon octicon-info" viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16" aria-hidden="true"><path d="M0 8a8 8 0 1 1 16 0A8 8 0 0 1 0 8Zm8-6.5a6.5 6.5 0 1 0 0 13 6.5 6.5 0 0 0 0-13ZM6.5 7.75A.75.75 0 0 1 7.25 7h1a.75.75 0 0 1 .75.75v2.75h.25a.75.75 0 0 1 0 1.5h-2a.75.75 0 0 1 0-1.5h.25v-2h-.25a.75.75 0 0 1-.75-.75ZM8 6a1 1 0 1 1 0-2 1 1 0 0 1 0 2Z"></path></svg> Note</p><p>Key learning is next time either just leave in Av mode and let the camera manage the transition and should be okay overall, OR‚Ä¶ manually tweak throughout the three stages of twilight, an involved process but will get the best results</p>
</div>

<p>Anyway, I had a go at stitching the stills together in DaVinci Resolve (excellent free video editing software).  I‚Äôd used it before for some basic video editing to assumed it could do this, and found a few videos that explained how to do it, though it‚Äôs a fairly simple process:</p>
<ul>
  <li>convert .raw files into .dng files (DaVinci‚Äôs preferred input) using the free Adobe DNG converter</li>
  <li>drag and drop photos into DaVinci Resolve‚Äôs ‚Äòmedia pool‚Äô</li>
  <li>check still duration set to 1 frame (preferences &gt; user &gt; editing) - otherwise it defaults to 5 secs</li>
  <li>that‚Äôs it - make tweaks to exposure / brightness / contrast etc of given frames as needed from within DR</li>
</ul>

<p>As DR has some quite powerful frame editing capabilities, I was able to adjust out some of my exposure mistakes, though I didn‚Äôt spend too long on it as keen to just take the learnings and try again.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFdRO0RsdMM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video</a> was the most useful I found for understanding how to do the timelapse in DR - with some additional information on how to adjust / enhance your timelapse too.</p>

<p>And my first attempt was:</p>

<p><em>Tips for next time</em>
Most complete video I found on timelapses was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgPLOOVvM9k&amp;t=7s" target="_blank">this one</a></p>

<ul>
  <li>Be prepared - note down what time the different phases of the transition from day to night are expected (see table below)</li>
  <li>Set up tripod, set shot in focus (for stars - around infinite)</li>
  <li>Intervals set to between 20-40 secs</li>
  <li>Be ready to start shooting around 30-40 mins before sunset</li>
  <li>Start at ISO100</li>
  <li>Aim to keep exposure at 0ev until sunset</li>
  <li>Do this by adjusting shutter speed before starting to adjust ISO</li>
  <li>Then allow it to come up</li>
  <li>Will need most changes during twilight phases, lessen off, and then none once fully night</li>
  <li>As you get to the end of civil twiling and into nautical twilight (when its dark in one part of the sky but light in another‚Ä¶) ev can drift down to around -0.3 to -0.7</li>
  <li>Once you hit nautical twilight, will need to be adjusting every 2-3mins</li>
  <li>Once the Shutter speed hits (rule of 500/400) max for avoiding trailing, then start adjusting ISO</li>
</ul>
