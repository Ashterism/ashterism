This blog is primarily a tool for me to record progress and experiences with some of my hobbies, whilst also helping me keep my hand in with digital.  I may use it to develop some articles that might be helpful to others later (astrophotography beginners or great hikes etc).   If anyone stumbles on it and finds my musings helpful or interesting, or have questions about any of the things I'm covering, feel free to get in touch.  

I have an on-off relationship with journalling, and for some topics it doesn't feel the best medium, especially when you want to include pictures (though I've always enjoyed drawing my own maps and diagrams etc).  But writing things down is a great process both for exploring and documenting your own thinking, but also to help with accountability.  In our 'always-on' world, it can be easy to neglect your hobbies, this is primarily a tool to help mitigate that!
