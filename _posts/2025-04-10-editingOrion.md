Following on from the [SkyHunter's first trip to the desert]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2025-03-30-SkyHunter-in-the-desert %}), I had a go at stacking and editing some of the image set 05.  I had a few goes trying slightly different approaches, which I'll outline below.  I used "standard settings" for things like registering, though realising now I come to writing it up, I don't have these written down anywhere.  I've recently had a go at editing some old photos where I've had to play with some of the settings I rarely change so it's a good time to document.  

ADD "STANDARD" settings

**For my first pass:**
1. Stacked in siril
2. No editing in siril
3. Exported as Tif
4. Tweaked curves / auto coloured / added a saturated layer
5. Saved as psd r_r_250330_05_stacked.psd

Finally getting round to putting this up on the blog, realising it would be helpful to have recorded if I made these changes using the Camera Raw filter, with adjustment layers, or just directly etc.  Be good to record more detail with that.  I do like this image though, despite the green tinge.  It's got a sharpness and a nice clarity to Iona Orionis (Naif Al Saif) - the double star, and brightest star in the sword (to the left of the main nebula in the centre).  Interestingly in the Orion constellation, this is towards the bottom (near the knees), so rotating it 90degrees anti-clockwise would be how we typically think of the orion orientation.  The two stars at the bottom (on the left) aren't Saiph and Rigel though, but Ori D and U respectively.
