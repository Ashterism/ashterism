Planning on heading out tomorrow.  Hopefully the milkyway will be nice and visible tomorrow night, so try and get some shots of that, but mostly try and get some better images of M13 Hercules cluster - and use the 90-120 mins whilst that’s happening to work on learning the constellations.  I’m aiming to have an Astroberry up and running to use as a way to platesolve and track more accurately, so fingers crossed for that!  I also have some camping tweaks to try to combat the heat, but that’s for another post!

## Astro targets ##
Probably just going for H13 and Milyway, but just in case I find i have more time...
