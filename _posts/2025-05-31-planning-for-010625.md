Planning on heading out tomorrow.  Hopefully the milkyway will be nice and visible tomorrow night, so try and get some shots of that, but mostly try and get some better images of M13 Hercules cluster - and use the 90-120 mins whilst that’s happening to work on learning the constellations.  I’m aiming to have an Astroberry up and running to use as a way to platesolve and track more accurately, so fingers crossed for that!  I also have some camping tweaks to try to combat the heat, but that’s for another post!

## Astro targets ##
Probably just going for H13 and Milyway, but just in case I find i have more time...

# R7 📸  and Stellarmate cheat sheet #

The default StellarMate OS password is smate
The default StellarMate WiFi HotSpot password is stellar@mate


For in the desert with no signal....

---

## 🔌 1. Gear Setup

- Mount tripod **level** and solid
- Attach **SkyHunter** in EQ mode
- Mount **Canon R7 + 100–400mm lens**
- Connect **R7 to Raspberry Pi** via USB-C (data cable)
- Power up the Pi (with StellarMate SD inserted)

---

## 📶 2. Connect to StellarMate

- From macair (or phone):
  - Wi-Fi: `stellarmate`
  - Password: `stellar@mate`

---

## 🖥️ 3. Open StellarMate App

- Launch the StellarMate app
- Tap your **equipment profile**, or create one:

### Example Profile:
- **Name**: `R7-SkyHunter`
- **CCD**: Canon DSLR (GPhoto)
- **Mount**: iOptron (SkyHunter) or Manual
- **Others**: leave blank

- Tap **Start**

---

## 📷 4. DSLR Camera Settings (First Time Only)

If prompted, enter:

- **Sensor Resolution**: `6960 x 4640`
- **Pixel Pitch**: `3.20 x 3.20`

Then tap **Save**

---

## 🔭 5. Focus + Frame

- Rough polar alignment (RA axis north)
- Use Bahtinov mask or take short test shots
- Frame target manually or via app controls
- Optional: use **Live View** if it works

---

## 📐 6. (Optional) Plate Solve

*Only works if Astrometry index files are pre-installed.*

- Tap **Capture & Solve**
- Tap **Sync** to align mount

---

## 📸 7. Start Imaging

In the **Capture tab**:

- **Exposure**: `120s` (2 minutes)
- **Count**: `30`
- **Format**: Native or FITS

Tap **Start Sequence**

---

## 💤 8. While It Runs

- Monitor for tracking drift
- Check framing every few shots
- Record ISO/exposure details

---

## 🧯 Troubleshooting (Offline)

- If R7 doesn’t show up: reboot Pi + reconnect
- If app freezes: reconnect to hotspot + re-launch
- Use short exposures to check if mount is tracking
