Heading to the desert this weekend, and not sure what would be the best target.  Had been thinking of getting a Milky way timelapse, but with a waxing gibbous moon not idea conditions to capture it, although would be good practice for framing and getting the holy grail settings right etc.

â€¦for future referenceâ€¦ <br>
&#x1F315; 12th May - Full moon <br>
&#x1F317; 20th May - Last quarter <br>
&#x1F311; 27 May - New Moon <br>

Other options are some moon photography, and/or targeting some brighter DSOs.  Itâ€™s all good practice, and ultimately the journey is as important as the destination!  I did look at getting a narrowband filter, but not cheap so something else for the one-day kit list.  Some DSOs which are apparently bright enough to still be good targets with a bright moon are below with some notes:

May 9th: Sunset: 6:55pm, Astronomical Twilight ends: 8:18pm

**General notes:**
* Tracking alignment going to be really important.  Maybe brush up on that.  
* Over 1600 ISO likely to be too noisy.
* Lower objects will have more atmospheric disturbance (wobble)
* Bahtinov would be really handy (still dont have one)

**Possible sequence:**
1. M13 (Hercules Cluster) - Early, while itâ€™s high and bright.
2. M44 (Beehive Cluster) - Before it sets around midnight.
3. M5 (Serpens Cluster) - High all night, so good for a longer session.
4. Omega Centauri & M8 - maybe skip as low?

Could also be an opportunity to find some constellations.  Itâ€™s something I really wanted to learn back at the beginning, but with moving somewhere that requires travelling for a good night sky, itâ€™s taken a bit of a back seat:

<table class="responsive-table">

      <th>Rising</th>
      <th>Brightest Star/Feature</th>
      <th>Notes</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Scorpius (The Scorpion)</td>
      <td>Southeast after sunset</td>
      <td>Antares (red supergiant)</td>
      <td>One of the most striking constellations, with a long, curving tail that looks great in wide-angle shots.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Sagittarius (The Archer)</td>
      <td>Southeast, just after Scorpius</td>
      <td>Teapot asterism</td>
      <td>This is where the core of the Milky Way sits, though itâ€™ll be a bit washed out.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Lyra (The Harp)</td>
      <td>High in the east</td>
      <td>Vega (part of the Summer Triangle)</td>
      <td>Easy to spot and a great focus for wide fields.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Hercules</td>
      <td>High in the east</td>
      <td>M13, the Hercules Globular Cluster</td>
      <td>Not as bright as others, but the cluster is a good long lens target.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Cygnus (The Swan)</td>
      <td>Rising in the northeast</td>
      <td>Deneb (part of the Summer Triangle)</td>
      <td>Contains the North America Nebula (NGC 7000), but this will be hard to capture with the bright moon.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
 

Then also the Moon and Jupiter.  Mars up too but bit small maybe?  Jupiter setting quite early might mean I could get it with desert in the foreground?  Get in some jupiter practice before the next opposition in January.

    <tr>
      <td>Jupiter</td>
      <td>WNW 8pm and low. Sets by 9:30pm</td>

> [!TIP]
> Using Livesky (sky safari web) or Stellarium was super helpful for planning, as was the Lumos app.  

> [!NOTE]
> Chucking notes, no matter how scrappy, and whether hand written (photos of) or typed into ChatGPT is such a quick way to get turned into a neat table with the html/md done for you ðŸ™‚

Also - another thought was doing an Earth rotation timelapse.  Requires perfect alignment so maybe not idea - but one I could do in an area with more light pollution in future maybe?

Lastly, and for some reason often forgotten though one of the things I love doing - astro landscapes!
