Heading to the desert this weekend, and not sure what would be the best target.  Had been thinking of getting a Milky way timelapse, but with a waxing gibbous moon not idea conditions to capture it, although would be good practice for framing and getting the holy grail settings right etc.

â€¦for future referenceâ€¦
&#x1F315; 12th May - Full moon
&#x1F317; 20th May - Last quarter
&#x1F311; 27 May - New Moon

Other options are some moon photography, and/or targeting some brighter DSOs.  Itâ€™s all good practice, and ultimately the journey is as important as the destination!  I did look at getting a narrowband filter, but not cheap so something else for the one-day kit list.  Some DSOs which are apparently bright enough to still be good targets with a bright moon are below with some notes:

May 9th: Sunset: 6:55pm, Astronomical Twilight ends: 8:18pm

General notes:
* Tracking alignment going to be really important.  Maybe brush up on that.  
* Over 1600 ISO likely to be too noisy.
* Lower objects will have more atmospheric disturbance (wobble)
* Bahtinov would be really handy (still dont have one)

Possible sequence:
1. M13 (Hercules Cluster) - Early, while itâ€™s high and bright.
2. M44 (Beehive Cluster) - Before it sets around midnight.
3. M5 (Serpens Cluster) - High all night, so good for a longer session.
4. Omega Centauri & M8 - maybe skip as low?

Could also be an opportunity to find some constellations.  Itâ€™s something I really wanted to learn back at the beginning, but with moving somewhere that requires travelling for a good night sky, itâ€™s taken a bit of a back seat:

Then also the Moon and Jupiter.  Mars up too but bit small maybe?  Jupiter setting quite early might mean I could get it with desert in the foreground?  Get in some jupiter practice before the next opposition in January.

> Using Livesky (sky safari web) or Stellarium was super helpful for planning, as was the Lumos app.

> Chucking notes, no matter how scrappy, and whether hand written (photos of) or typed into ChatGPT is such a quick way to get turned into a neat table with the html/md done for you ðŸ™‚

Also - another thought was doing an Earth rotation timelapse.  Requires perfect alignment so maybe not idea - but one I could do in an area with more light pollution in future maybe?
